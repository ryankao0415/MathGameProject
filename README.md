# MathGameProject
GAME RULES:

10 questions (addition/subtraction/mult/division) +1 for the right question and +0 for the wrong question 1 attempt per question Top 5 scores will be displayed Random question generator (with random values)

GUI LAYOUT:

4 options 1 correct, random generated Check using if Just click the button with the number on it Display score top Use colors and sound effects to indicate the answer (highlight the right answer) Background picture/pictures If we do time limit, top corner

ALGORITHM:

Class game “Main function” that outputs and calls other functions, no parameters Function to ask username checks if name is in the top 5 (initial top 5 hardcoded), takes String name, int score, Function that displays the top 5 (array sorting maybe) Hard code initial top 5 Checks if name on the top 5 Option Function that uses a random number gen 1-100, takes in 3 numbers, int num1, int num2, int type Make sure the answer is one of the options
Answer Function, numbers 1-4 (answers) to get addition/sub/multi/div, 1-100 for question values Passes 2 numbers for the questions and one number for the type Driver code

GOALS: Figure out our algorithm Build basic GUI structure Test game Maybe add animation, sounds or music

TASKS: ALEX- “Main function” that outputs and calls other functions, no parameters 
VIKRAM- sounds, colors, animations GUI 
Jeffrey- Function to ask username checks if name is in the top 5 (initial top 5 hardcoded), takes String name, int score, Function that displays the top 5 (array sorting maybe) Hard code initial top 5 Checks if name on the top 5 
Ryan- Function that uses a random number gen 1-100 for numbers 1-4 for addition/sub/multi/div (generates random math problem)

Add music question Background Eliminated options Add timer Most questions the user can answer in 2 minutes
